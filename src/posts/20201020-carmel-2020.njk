<div>So the first bikepacking trip for the Twenty Peaks Challenge in the works. Short and sweet as they like to say but may not end up being as sweet as you would like to think. Throw a piece of spaghetti on a map, add some tough climbs and you're well on your way to getting a route setup for the Twenty Peaks. This was not intended I don't think to be done as a bikepacking eventy but then again convention has rarely been my way of life. The Carmel creates a border between the Galilee and the Central pleins of Israel. Haifa is one of the largest cities in Israel and comes into play in the northern part of the route. Let's hope we can find a few shops open to spoil ourselves during the ride. I know that if I make it that far I'll have earned it.</div>
