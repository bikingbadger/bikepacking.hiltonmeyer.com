My digital playground for sharing my Israel bikepacking trips and eventually also abroad. I like to keep things as simple as possible and I have no problem slapping the bags onto my road bike, mountain bike or gravel bike and heading off in the direction of the sunset. That's the beauty of bikepacking in my eyes and I would really not want to start chasing my own tail and trying to put bikepacking into some kind of category of what you can and can't do. It should just be a free come and you go type of ride from a day all the way to months at a time. Why try and pin something down when you should rather just be encouraging people to get out there. You could call it touring, who cares. The most important thing is to get out and get your arse on the saddle, drink in those amazing views and meet some interesting people along the way. {class="md:my-16 md:mx-8 md:text-justify md:text-lg leading-relaxed"}

Adventure has been something that started in high school with my love of sport and the outdoors. My knee's were generally scabbed over from falling and sitting still was not on the menu until bedtime. The love of the bike came from the freedom of being able to hop on the saddle and get away and into nature with a few peddle strokes. I had a dream of cycling from my home country of South Africa to Cairo. A dream I still harbor and will one day fulfill. This sense of adventure led me to visit Israel, a country I knew very little about but was slightly off the beaten track. And here I stayed in this small country that still has so much variety. {class="md:my-16 md:mx-8 md:text-justify md:text-lg leading-relaxed"}

This was where my real cycling adventure started. I did quite a bit of racing in the local mountain bike scene. My brother in law at the time was also riding and convinced me to ride across the country with him. Now Israel isn't massive but I was in now way near the type of rider putting in huge rides a day let along back to back. We somehow made it and that seed was planted. This was around 10 years ago, the seed was sown and now I am finally getting around to getting into the outdoors more and exploring the country and hopefully others on the back on my bike. This will be the place where I share those experiences and maybe meet a few people along the way. {class="md:my-16 md:mx-8 md:text-justify md:text-lg leading-relaxed"}
