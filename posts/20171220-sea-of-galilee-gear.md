My setup was to get out on the first outing using what I had lying around without having to buy too much stuff. Having invested in the Apidura seatbag and handlebar bag I wanted to get out there and start making changes based on experiences out in nature. Due to space concerns I had to take a back pack so you can see what I was basically carrying on me and not on the bike below.

So as you can see this is not lightweight setup at all but rather just getting out there. I've already highlighted a few things that I will definitely start taking weight off. The sleeping setup is my first concern and also obviously stuff that I took that wasn't really needed, such as a the leatherman and extra un-used clothing. The jacket could really get slimmed down.
